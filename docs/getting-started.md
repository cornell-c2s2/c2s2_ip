# Getting Started
Hello, and welcome to C2S2!

To get started, you'll want to make sure you have access to the following things:
* [C2S2's Confluence Page](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/c2s2)
* Added to C2S2's Github Organization
  * Go to your github profile and look in the bottom left, under **Organizations**. If C2S2's logo appears there, you're in!
* [C2S2's ecelinux Machine](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/c2s2/Accessing+the+Team+Server)
  * Follow the tutorial linked above, if anything doesn't work, let us know!

If for some reason you don't have access to any of these, contact your subteam leads.

## Using the IP

Next, you'll want to get your working environment set up. If you don't already have experience with `git` and `github`, we recommend taking a look at the [Git/Github Primer](https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=476108648) on confluence.
